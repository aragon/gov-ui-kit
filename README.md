# Governance UI Kit

The Aragon Governance UI Kit is an open source and human-centric design system specifically designed for OSx-based
onchain organizations. It provides a unified and easy-to-use framework for creating visually consistent and engaging
interfaces, prioritizing user experience throughout the Aragon ecosystem.

**NOTE**: The Governance UI Kit library is currently in pre-alpha stage; breaking changes may occur.

**Key Features:**

- **OSx-compatible**: Pre-built components and patterns tailored for Aragon OSx governance workflows.
- **Unified design language**: Streamlined visuals and interactions for cohesive user experiences.
- **Accessible & responsive**: Adheres to accessibility best practices and scales well across different devices.
- **Designer-friendly**: Includes a comprehensive Figma library to accelerate prototyping and iteration.
- **Developer-focused**: Straightforward installation, theming options, and easily composable components.

## Designers

Designers can access the UI Kit in Figma to explore and adapt components for their own components and use cases. This
Storybook reflects the latest design tokens, styles, and components, so should be considered the "source of truth".
