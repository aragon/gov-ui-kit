# Governance UI Kit

The Aragon Governance UI Kit is an open source and human-centric design system specifically designed for OSx-based onchain organizations. It provides a unified and easy-to-use framework for creating visually consistent and engaging interfaces, prioritizing user experience throughout the Aragon ecosystem.

**NOTE**: The Governance UI Kit library is currently in pre-alpha stage; breaking changes may occur.

**Key Features:**
- **OSx-compatible**: Pre-built components and patterns tailored for Aragon OSx governance workflows.
- **Unified design language**: Streamlined visuals and interactions for cohesive user experiences.
- **Accessible & responsive**: Adheres to accessibility best practices and scales well across different devices.
- **Designer-friendly**: Includes a comprehensive Figma library to accelerate prototyping and iteration.
- **Developer-focused**: Straightforward installation, theming options, and easily composable components.

## Designers

Designers can access the UI Kit in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1228026689149097807) to explore and adapt components for their own components and use cases. This Storybook reflects the latest design tokens, styles, and components, so should be considered the "source of truth".

## Getting started building an application

To start building with the UI Kit, follow our [Installation](https://aragon.github.io/gov-ui-kit/?path=/docs/docs-installation) doc. It covers how to set up your environment and start importing components.

If you’re looking to launch a custom application more quickly on OSx, check out the [Governance App Template](https://devs-stg.aragon.org/gov-app-template/1.x/). It demonstrates how to integrate UI Kit components into a full-stack governance application, with some common governance patterns pre-built
