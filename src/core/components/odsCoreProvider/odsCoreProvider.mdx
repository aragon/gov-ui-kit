The `<OdsCoreProvider />` is a React context that defines the image and link elements to be rendered across all the ODS
components, defaulting such values to `<img />` and `<a />` tags. The provider is used by the `<AvatarBase />` and
`<LinkBase />` components, which are in turn used by all the other core and module components.

The provider becomes particularly useful when an application needs to employ framework-specific images or links, such as
the `<Image />` and `<Link />` components from NextJs.

Refer to the component's properties below for more details on the default configuration objects used for each provider.
