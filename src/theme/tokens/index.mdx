# Tokens

The design tokens in the `@aragon/gov-ui-kit` UI library serve as the foundational elements for creating consistent and
visually appealing interfaces. These tokens are implemented using
[CSS custom variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) and, when integrated with Tailwind CSS,
they can be conveniently accessed through Tailwind classes. When used as a standalone library, design tokens should be
used as CSS custom properties.

## Usage

### With Tailwind CSS

In projects using both `@aragon/gov-ui-kit` and `Tailwind CSS`, design tokens are readily available as Tailwind classes.
For instance:

```html
<div class="bg-primary-500 mt-2">
    <!-- Content with design tokens applied -->
</div>
```

### Standalone Usage

When using `@aragon/gov-ui-kit` as a standalone library, design tokens are applied as CSS custom properties. For
example:

```css
.my-section {
    margin-top: calc(var(--spacing) * 2);
    color: var(--color-primary-500);
}
```

## Categories

- **Primitive**: Establish the core elements of the design system, including colors, typography, spacing, and more.

- **Semantic (SOON)**: Provide an abstraction layer over primitive tokens, enabling the definition of application
  themes.

- **Component-Specific (SOON)**: Allow users to customize individual components according to their preferences.
